This visualization uses data provided by the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory at NASA](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) and [Keplerian equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_equation) to determine the positions of planets and satellites at any given time. It is named for the astronomer [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe) and is inspired by *The Orrery* by C. C. Foster and [100,000 Stars](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/chrome/100000-stars) by the Google Data Arts team.\n\nThe full source code for this project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jshor/tycho2).\n\n## Instructions\n\n* Use your mouse, trackpad, or touch screen to orbit around a visual.\n* Click on a planet or satellite label to focus on it, and click on the visual name to see information on it.\n* To zoom, scroll or pinch the screen, or move the vertical slider located on the left.\n* Change the date of the visualization using the calendar on the top right corner, and use the **Speed Scale** to inflate time.\n* Use the **Planet Scale** slider to change the size of the planets and their satellites.\n* Toggle the sound by clicking the volume bars on the bottom left.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis visualization doesn't account for astronomical anomalies (such as aberrations from other celestial objects) so accuracy is only guaranteed within few hundred years from the current.\n\n## Credits\n\n* Project developed by [Josh Shor](http://josh.so).\n* Planetary ephemerides courtesy of [NASA](https://jpl.nasa.gov/) and the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.nasa.gov/).\n* Orbital textures by [James Hastings-Trew](http://planetpixelemporium.com/) and contributors to the [Celestia Motherlode](http://www.celestiamotherlode.net/).\n* Ambient music [*Ultra Deep Field*](https://soundcloud.com/stellardrone/stellardrone-ultra-deep-field) by [Stellardrone](https://soundcloud.com/stellardrone).\n* Special thanks to the open source community for [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/)/[Redux](http://redux.js.org/), [THREE.js](https://threejs.org), and [react-three-renderer](https://github.com/toxicFork/react-three-renderer).\n\n*For science.*"
