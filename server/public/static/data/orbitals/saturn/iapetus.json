    "description": "Iapetus (Greek: Ιαπετός), or occasionally Japetus, is the third-largest natural satellite of Saturn, eleventh-largest in the Solar System, and the largest body in the Solar System known not to be in hydrostatic equilibrium. Iapetus is best known for its dramatic \"two-tone\" coloration. Discoveries by the Cassini mission in 2007 revealed several other unusual features, such as a massive equatorial ridge running three-quarters of the way around the moon.\n\nExcerpt via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iapetus_(moon))."
