It is named after Mimas, a son of Gaia in Greek mythology, and is also designated Saturn I.\n\nWith a diameter of 396 kilometres (246 mi) it is the smallest astronomical body that is known to be rounded in shape because of self-gravitation.\n\nExcerpt via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimas_(moon))."
